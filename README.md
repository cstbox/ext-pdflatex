# Shared tools for LaTeX based documents generation

This extension makes possible to easily generate complex PDF documents 
including charts and any elaborated features by using LaTeX as renderer.
 
## Runtime dependencies

This extension requires the CSTBox core to be already installed and a 
suitable LaTeX (TexLive based suggested) distribution. This distribution
can (should) be brought down to the minimal set of required features in
order to keep its size reasonable.
